# About

<p>
A large part of this project has been collaboration and teamwork with all of the group members. We opened up a Trello board, communicated about
GitHub commits, and distributed the work between us. It has been a huge learning experience and also quite necessary for the field we're working in.
We are super proud of the work we've done and we hope you enjoy our project!

<p><b><u>Note: </u></b>One of our previous versions were requesting the YouTube API too often and used up our tokens instantly. <a href="https://github.com/waiLeongChong">Wai Leong Chong</a> brought this to our attention and fixed the issue. This means that the <ins>duration</ins> and <ins>view count</ins> will <b>no longer</b> be displayed as shown in the screenshots. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
